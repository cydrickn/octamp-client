# SWamp Client
SWamp Client is an open source client for [WAMP (Web Application Messaging Protocol)](https://wamp-proto.org/), for PHP.

SWamp Client uses [Open Swoole](https://openswoole.com/docs), is a high-performance network framework based on an event-driven, asynchronous, non-blocking I/O coroutine programming model for PHP.

We also design the SWamp Client functions to be identical to [AutobahnJS](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-js)

The name SWamp is from Swoole + WAMP
